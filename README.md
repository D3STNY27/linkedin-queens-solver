# LinkedIn Queens Solver

🚀 **LinkedIn Queens Solver** is a Python project that automatically solves "Queens" puzzles by LinkedIn mini-games.  
It places queens on a grid according to the puzzle rules without conflicts.

It combines:
1. Selenium Automations: Dynamically fetches grid from selected "Source" website and places queens after solution is found.
2. Anaytical Solving (Follow the constraints of the puzzle and place queens also removing cells where queen cannot be placed)
3. Backtracking (Although linkedin queens can be solved with analytical solution most of the times, backtracking is added if there is incomplete analytical solution)

Note - Queens-Game is a similar website where queens puzzles are available but they usually contain more than 1 solution where backtracking is required~
